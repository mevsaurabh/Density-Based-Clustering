# Genetic Algorithms (GAs)

## Introduction

Genetic Algorithms (GAs) are adaptive heuristic search algorithms that belong to the larger part of evolutionary algorithms. These algorithms are based on the ideas of natural selection and genetics. GAs are characterized by:

- Intelligent exploitation of random search
- Use of historical data to direct the search
- Focus on regions of better performance in the solution space

They are commonly used to generate high-quality solutions for optimization problems and search problems.

## Natural Selection Simulation

Genetic algorithms simulate the process of natural selection. This simulation reflects the following principles:

1. Species that can adapt to changes in their environment are more likely to:
   - Survive
   - Reproduce
   - Pass their genes to the next generation

2. In simple terms, GAs simulate "survival of the fittest" among individuals of consecutive generations to solve a problem.

## Key Features

- Based on principles of natural selection and genetics
- Work with a population of potential solutions
- Use genetic operators (e.g., mutation, crossover)
- Iterative process, creating new generations of solutions

## Applications

GAs are widely used in various fields, including:

- Optimization problems
- Search problems
- Machine learning
- Bioinformatics
- Engineering design

## Conclusion

Genetic Algorithms offer a powerful approach to solving complex problems by mimicking the processes of natural selection and evolution.
